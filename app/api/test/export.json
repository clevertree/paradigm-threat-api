The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up.\n\nAs they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000.\n\nBut here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.”",

This was classified by EMA as a “major objection” along with observed visible particles, which were classified as “impurities.”\nA leaked 26 November PowerPoint presentation of a meeting between Pfizer-BioNTech and the EMA revealed how this major objection was shockingly ‘resolved’- the RNA integrity specification was simply lowered to 50%, therefore half of all mRNA molecules in the commercial batches were allowed to be truncated (not intact).\nThe potential implications of the RNA integrity loss in terms of safety and efficacy were unknown.\nDegradation of mRNA may be a blessing in disguise by generating less of the lethal WIV once in the body",

It makes no logical sense to me, to help someone who wants to kill you and your family, presuming self preservation is the goal.\n2+3. Real zombies does not prove the existence of a transmissible particle. Real science could.  For three years I've been looking for any evidence to prove the existence of any virus particle that is either transmissible or causes illness. That is proof doing the scientific method with basic controls to eliminate error the the method.  Nothing found. Despite constant researching my 1000s of people who know science, nobody anywhere can find such a science study.  In fact when people in courts of law have asked virologists if they do science when finding a virus, they have answered no. \"We didn't have time for that\". The method used, finds what they want to find, in any sample. Closer to fraud than science.  Also the illusion of particle transmission is very easily explained by a different process.\n\nHere are some references if you are curious:\n9 mins video.

A concept of life which each individual can choose.”\n\nLater Gaub faced fierce a backlash online, including some commenters accusing her of ‘racism’.

Toxic Chemicals like Fluoride in Food and Water.\n2. Man Made Viruses and Diseases like Fauci’s AIDS virus, when he placed them in Vaccines that were Specifically Targeted to the GAY Population. Also included were multiple man made mutations of the flu, Ebola, etc. The first outbreak was supposed to be released in late 2017 or 2018… well, it was actually 2019.\n3. Chemtrails — filled with heavy metals and numerous chemicals that are Neurotoxins, thus why we see the newly labeled Autoimmune Diseases introduced, sperm counts in men have dropped 50% since they began this project, and respiratory and cancer rates have skyrocketed. They would use both outdated passenger aircraft and especially today, Military Aircraft.\n\n4. UFO Invasion: In March of 1997 the Pheonix Lights became Mainstream Media news. In 1986 underground Boulder Colorado – Project Sky Beam. Andre Garros, there was a HUGE Projected Hologram of what appeared to be a massive Stealth Bomber. Hologram tech took off in the 50’s and now who really knows how much it has advanced, but it was pretty remarkable back in 1986. The Pheonix Lights was the first large scale test of their Projection Technology.\n\nThe FINAL Stage of their Sinister Plan is supposed to take place in 2024, they plan on causing a fake UFO invasion event with the purpose of brining in Martial Law. From their on, everything will change and our freedom will be gone forever.\nReal Military Jets within these Holograms will actually bomb the nations with their high tech never seen before Laser Like Weapons.\n\nThe GOAL and Main Objective is to SCARE the Living Shit out of EVERYONE on the Planet to make them LISTEN to the Government so they can bring home their NEW WORLD ORDER of a Single Government for the entire Planet.\n\nFrom this day forward all the nations will be in slavery under this new government and the viral pandemics and vaccinations will escalate and the population of the world will quickly begin to decline to reach their goal of only 800 million left in 2030… according to this video, but I personally have heard that the true goal is 500 Million by 2050. Either way, it is pure EVIL.\nWe have to resist these Vaccines and WAKE UP to what they are trying to do.\n\nThe Global Economic and Social Reset is scheduled for 2025.\n\n– Man-made Flu Around 2018 To Depopulate the World To 800 Million.

Whatever the loss, they just push it further into the future enslaving those who are to come\n\nC Austin Fitts has mentioned the Fed’s “going direct” is part and parcel of a new way for Central banking to reach and hence control the… individual ",

It was, deservedly, never produced, though when the playwright sent Freud a copy, the doctor wrote him back, in English: “I soon was swept away by the passionate rhythm. I enjoyed the thing immensely. I see I was right for trusting your powers as a writer. Take my congratulations for your work.” Freud frequently blamed the American president for the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He told a friend, “As far as a single person can be responsible for the misery of this part of the world, he surely is.” https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-drove-sigmund-freud-write-scandalous-biography-woodrow-wilson-180970042/",

Hence the \"egyptians\" worshipped RA.  This video discusses \"russian\" technology using RAdar that can either cause disease or entirely fix diseases depending on the settings, and also for earthquakes, amongst many other things including bisecting radar waves that can cause detonations on the ground that could be confused for nuclear weapons.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Ggmi_6JFU\u0026list=WL\u0026index=1\u0026ab_channel=dutchsinse. It's possible the earthquake tech that was used (as it seems to be today) to manage earthquakes prior, later was used as a weapon to wipe out stuff in the 1800s.  \n\nImagine creating a localized torus field using magnets and radium to literally view anywhere in the matrix.  Some UFOs could be artifacts of \"remote viewing\" from these devices rather than flying vehicles.  While other vehicles are actually spinning disks.  There are radium caves in Austria that are used for health.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreykabat/2019/02/02/in-germany-and-austria-visits-to-radon-health-spas-are-covered-by-health-insurance/\n\nViewing anywhere in the matrix also implies \"time travel\" within the holograph.  The moon is probably the reflection of the base holographic plate that two intersecting somethings cross to show this \"reality\".\n\nI have heard that the drilling of oil and gas releases radium which I'm guessing is captured.  The article about the radium flying vehicle mentions a radium metal that was used to line the inside of the vehicle and apergy.  Apergy is the 1800s word for \"anti-gravity\" where apergy is found in the Jacob Astor book about visiting other planets.  \n\nThere is a monopoly on radium and related technology likely for good reason.",

Legacy media reports, however, use characteristically neutral wording when evidence starts to stack up against Israel. “112 dead in chaotic scenes as Israeli troops open fire near aid trucks, say Gaza officials,” a Guardian headline reads. Palestinians always seem to just “die,” not get killed, and Israeli troops seem to have just “opened fire” nearby. The skewed wording conventions persist even despite the attribution to Palestinian officials present in that same headline – officials like the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, which was quite clear in accusing Israel of perpetrating a ”massacre” as part of a “genocidal war.”",

Scientists must take care not to substitute an old set of dogmas with a new one. It’s time to stop pretending that, give or take a few bits and pieces, we know how life works. Instead, we must let our ideas evolve as more discoveries are made in the coming decades. Sitting in uncertainty, while working to make those discoveries, will be biology’s great task for the twenty-first century.",

Until the 19th century most Christians thought of the OT as evil and contradictory, while the NT was more divinely inspired. The former was inspired by those who would misinterpret the actions of their worshiped god for purposes of control, division, war, usury, and everything else the NT judicial literature BANNED. So the Protestants and Catholics destroyed/catharized the original Christian Gnostic Cathars (and Khazars) and replaced their religion with the version we know. This version features endless war and there have been many crusades and more slaves today than any time in history. Thanks Christianity. \n\nPoint is, they are still controlling you with the bad OT literature. LGBTQIA+ in itself is not a threat. They will never have any power and they can't organize or establish common themes/platforms. LGB was legitimate, TQIA+ was not. Just like the NT being redacted by the OT. You HAVE to split these things apart to understand them. What you're afraid of here is the destruction of the family, and you know well that that destruction began long before we were born. Our US government, which was founded on OT principles, is evil, and has nothing do with the original Christianity it was escaping. It is our enemy, not the people it sends to kill us.",

Three of the six miners died. Yet this extraordinary finding was not widely shared with the scientific community. It was uncovered after the emergence of COVID-19 by the independent research group DRASTIC.\n\nExperts agree that RaTG13 could not have been the direct progenitor of COVID-19.

From my website: \n\nThe Deep State is a clandestine 'royal bloodline' that imposes systems of control over other humans in all towns, cities, states and countries within their influence. On April 27, 1961 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations\"\n\nWhom then are the beneficiaries of global conspiracy? Often in a controlled-opposition environment, you'll find amateur conspiracy theorists railing against a particular race, religion, or creed. You'll see conspirator accusations thrown at 'The British', 'The Jews', non-human ETs, dimensional demons, or even 'The Devil' himself. It's important to understand the Deep State is loyal to no race, religion, or creed, but rather only to their family. If you see any corporate shills like David Icke accusing an entire race or alien species of a conspiracy, just remember, they are just being racist.",

Hundreds of thousands dead, but damage limited to Ukraine. \nThe War with China was talked about for at least 20 years, and I don't think that mine will ever go off - I predict zero dead soldiers between UN+Nato and China over the Taiwan thing. China plans to take it over peacefully. \nWar between Iran and Israel was a mine growing since 1979 and probably much sooner. The plan was to trigger a war between Christians+Jews against Muslims. Israel attacked Iran on Feb2. As we know the attack was a failure. Did BB order a *symbolic* drone attack? I think so. They want zero bodies in that war too. There has been already too many assassinations anyway. BB is diffusing this mine by symbolical saber rattling against it - ironic. He knows that a peace deal between Iran and USA would have guaranteed a war later on when Iran renigs on the uranium agreements.",

In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health. Immune cells that have taken up the vaccine nanoparticles release into circulation large numbers of exosomes containing spike protein along with critical microRNAs that induce a signaling response in recipient cells at distant sites. We also identify potential profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These disturbances potentially have a causal link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis.”",

In fact, I don't see any other way to pull off this psyop. I keep seeing the whole 'Only 1% of deaths are reported' line without any reference or proof. Our side has accepted that statistic on faith without looking into it. An optimal vaccine population control psyop has no reason to kill people rapidly - that would give the psyop away. The vaccines are most likely designed to do everything to a person, including shortening their lifespan and preventing offspring, *except* killing them rapidly",

In reaction, authors like Thomas Huxley began arguing that within the incredible void of information caused by the Church, we literally, functionally, and actually don't know anything anymore. This is in contrast to a long period between 600-300 years ago when:\n1. There was only one world religion, Christianity. \n2. Anybody who cared to know anything about religion, science, history, or biology was never forbidden to it (unlike today when women are still forbidden from holy text and much of science) \n3. There were no government mandated schools put in place after countless wars to reeducate the populations of every country with education that is literally, functionally, and actually false.\nThe ignorance we are experiencing right now is not our fault. It is absolutely nothing more than a weapon of war, something we need to heal from when the wars finally end",

In other words, the disappearance was not the result of the teleportation, but rather came before it.\n\nOnce the USS Eldridge reached Norfolk, it was clear something went wrong. Some of the men had disappeared during the trip. Others had gone mad. Some kept becoming invisible and then regaining their forms. Others still had become fused — yes, fused — with the ship in various ways.",

Buddha in Hinduism\n'Buddha' as incarnation of Vishnu was introduced as a tool to co-opt Buddhism in the Puranic period from 8th century onwards. This happened due to mention of Buddha as a maya-moha / deceptive avatara of Vishnu as mentioned in Agni Puran, Linga Puran, Bhagvat Puran etc.",

Recently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in the Kherson and Kharkov sections of the front, which was called the \"offensive of the last chance\" in Ukrainian TG channels. Irretrievable losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction up to 20 thousand people are defined as acceptable. The front line is practically littered with the corpses of the Ukrainian military, no one spares manpower.\n\nThe Western masters of the Kyiv regime are strict and know how to count money - they want to get the maximum return on their invested dollars, euros and pounds sterling.\n\nAnd Zelensky's gang is trying with all its might to prove its usefulness and necessity to the moderators of the armed conflict in Ukraine, represented by the US and Britain, fearing that it will be replaced by more effective middle managers, such as the Zaluzhny gang, the head of the AFU.\n\nWhat is not visible in this arrangement are the interests of ordinary Ukrainians. They have been reduced to the level of expendable material. And nothing strategically depends on them or on the Ukrainian top brass.\n\nAs former US Senator Richard Hayden Black put it in late April 2022: \"I don't think Ukraine can make decisions about peace at all. Such decisions are made in Washington. And as long as we want to continue these military actions, we will conduct them with the hands of Ukrainians, and we will fight to the last Ukrainian.\"\n\n@russtrat",

'Mr  Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once/   \"While waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for  his car, Hagen saw two women about to enter a long limousine  already parked in the driveway. They were the beautiful  twelve-year-old blonde girl and her mother ^e had seen in  Woltz’s office that morning. But now the girl’s exquisitely cut  mouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. Her  sea-blue eyes were Aimed over and when she walked down the  steps towards the open car her long legs tottered like a crippled  foal’s. Her mother supported the child, helping her into the  car, hissing commands into her ear. The mother’s head turned  for a quick furtive look at Hagen and he saw in her eyes a  burning, hawklike triumph. Then she too disappeared into the  limousine.   So that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los  Angeles, Hagen thought. The girl and her mother had made  the trip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz  enough time to relax before dinner and do the job on the little  kid. And Johnny wanted to live in this world? Good luck to  him, and good luck to Woltz.

I know, without any evidence, because the predictive programming tells us: There is a real shrinking technology out there they want us to believe is fake. It doesn't work on lifeforms, that much is real. It only works on uniform material, like solid metal. It removes atoms from the metal while maintaining it's structure. All the lost material is 100% recovered and reused. The remains of the process - a tiny microchip with 5nm between the semiconductors. Without the shrinking technology which everyone thinks is science fiction, NOBODY knows how to build microchips.",

      "message": "Before the French, Spanish or English, America had Russian colonies who were 100% allied with the natives. By contrast, the European colonists (both Catholic and Protestant) committed systematic genocide against the natives and constantly broke their own treaties. After the Russian Empire fell apart in 1775 (due to the Rebellion of Pugachev), the Europeans conspired to claim all the land and relocate the indigenous populations. The Declaration of Independence marked the natives as the enemies (\"merciless indian savages\") and made no mention of the Russian Empire. Europeans then force-relocated many natives (Trail of Tears) across the Bering Straight (which was still intact in the early 19th century) to a location alien to them - Asia. European historians then reduced the Russian Empire to small locations in Europe, Asia, and north America as if it had little significance. They left behind endless contradictions (like the so-called \"Indians\") that are still very poorly explained. The only reason these facts haven't made it into our American history books yet is because including the war of 1812, this country has been part of 4 world wars all of which had a single goal - destroy Russia and it's history.",

Continuing reports consist of miners feeling strange tactile sensations and distortions in vision and hearing, which is likely the result of the electromagnetic field. Some report disturbing thoughts or compulsions, irregular heartbeats, limb paralysis, muscle tremors, or vertigo, and nausea. Excavation has been carried out with standard non-ferrous beryllium copper and tungsten carbide fusion-electric powered mining equipment modified with sealed operator cockpits and atmosphere filtration units. A typical mining cycle involves placing chemical charges above an ore deposit using satellite-positioned drill trucks, detonating the charges to loosen the overburden, then removing the overburden with excavators and dozers.",

      "message": "*Q\u0026A: Earth is controlled by Humans on Mars*\nNote: This investigation is **a work in progress**. Check back soon for more updates!\n*Q: Why is Earth 'controlled'?*\nThe assassination of President John F Kennedy reminded humanity that an invisible technocratic influence which has come to be known as the Deep State had the final say on events in Earth's affairs in history. The Deep State imposes its jurisdiction over every human on Earth, without our consent (or awareness).\n\n*Q: What is the Deep State?*\nThe Deep State is a clandestine 'royal bloodline' that imposes systems of control over other humans in all towns, cities, states and countries within their influence. On April 27, 1961 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n```For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations```\n\nWhom then are the beneficiaries of global conspiracy? Often in a controlled-opposition environment, you'll find amateur conspiracy theorists railing against a particular race, religion, or creed. You'll see conspirator accusations thrown at 'The British', 'The Jews', non-human ETs, dimensional demons, or even 'The Devil' himself. It's important to understand the Deep State is loyal to no race, religion, or creed, but rather only to their family. If you see any corporate shills like David Icke accusing an entire race or alien species of a conspiracy, just remember, they are just being racist.\n\n*Q: Where is the Deep State?*\nMartial Law. Maritime. Marshalling. Marching. Mergers. Martyrdom. Murder. Marring. These familiar terms of conquest are named after the planet of conquest: Mars. The origins of these words suggest systems of control imposed upon us by humans who associate themselves with the planet Mars. The headquarters of the Deep State is located in the secret places of the Earth, as well as places we were told Humans cannot live, like on the inside of the planet Mars.\n\n*Q: Why would the Deep State be on Mars?*\nAncient testimony tells us the 'true' origin story of Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and the Sun! (oh and the other planets were sorta involved too). The real history of our solar system is recent, not millions or billions of years long. Earth shares an incubated safe space with Mercury, Venus, and Mars that allows for periodic quantum entanglement without interference. Occasionally, Birkeland currents will flow between these planets. The coma tail of Venus prevents quantum entanglement and safe travel, as does the asteroid belt. Mercury may be a viable quantum-tunnel travel location. The most natural and safest periodic quantum gates exist between Earth and Mars. These gates were formed during inter-planetary discharges of electricity, the same kind of lightning scarring that carved the Grand Canyons.\n\nThis quantum-entanglement technology allowed technocratic Deep State to establish a Pyramidal Empire on Earth and Mars which spread across the planets converting or killing every indigenous civilization it encountered. This inland empire still dominates inner solar system affairs today.",

According to Zeev Sternell, historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, “Israel thought that it was a smart ploy to push the Islamists against the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)”. (L’Humanité, translated from French)\n\nThe links of Hamas to Mossad and US intelligence have been acknowledged by Rep. Ron Paul in a statement to the U.S. Congress: “Hamas Was Started by Israel”?\n\n    “You know Hamas, if you look at the history, you’ll find out that Hamas was encouraged and really started by Israel because they wanted Hamas to counteract Yasser Arafat… (Rep. Ron Paul, 2011)",

      "message": "[@Udrys999](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTJ_TyoSNCLLXYTz_BNdq8Q) \n\n • 1 month ago\n\nI suppose the Great Reset in 1812 wasn't triggered by musket and horse-buggy technology? Was the world back then completely different technologically? Also evidence points that the last global reset took place after the alleged WW2, somewhere near 1960-1970. I've found discussion on this topic only in the Russian speaking internet. English internet points the reset to 19th century. Some points to this theory: \\- Pre-reset architecture is to esthetic and doesn't even satisfy human needs. Kitchens, toilets, heating were added after the reset. (Stalin's high-rises, Stalin's architecture style). Weirdly high ceilings and doors. Also lack of photo and video evidence, that documents the construction process. \\- Bizarre details of siege of Leningrad. Germans didn't capture it for no reason. Famine in the city, yet the military factories worked and produced vehicles, receiving goods and sending tanks via train lines. \\- Soviet soldier remains left on battlefield for 10-20 years. Burial operations only in 1960s. \\- Disappearance of all post-WW2 disabled veterans. Allegedly due to soviet repressions, but veterans also vanished in Western Europe. \\- People that were adults during WW2, have no stories to tell about the events. They mostly remain silent, sometimes say their head hurts and they don't want to talk about it. On rare occasions stories involve physics defying details (i.e. \"we used powder on rooftops to stop bombs from detonating\"). Doesn't matter were these people soldiers or civilians and what of former USSR they come from - complete silence. Other evidence may point the fallacy of all previous history. \\- Chaotic creation of new states and autonomous regions after the October Revolution. Sudden appearance of new nationalities with respective languages and borders. Most of these states wouldn't last several years. \\- The rapid industrial growth of USA and USSR in second half of 19th century and first half of 20th century respectively does not fit into economics and logic. \\- You can't build a ship with a hammer and an axe. Crossing seas and oceans with wooden boats is impossible, boats will be torn to pieces by waves. You can't steer a giant sail-ship to dock into narrow harbors and passages. \\- Colonial architecture and ancient temples are impossible to build with hand-tools. \\- No psychological basis for gatherer tribes to switch to violent hierarchies, hard-labor and inefficient agriculture. \\- No reason for early human tribes to emigrate far from tropical areas and even beyond the polar circle. These and many more evidences may point the world experiences chronological paradoxes. People may travel these paradoxes with their memories reset and new memories uploaded. Another explanation is that the world simply started in 1960s and all prior artifacts and people are made by something resembling a modern image-generating A.I.",

      "message": "\"Civil War was funded on both sides by Britain, much like the Revolutionary War. The so-called Revolution of 1776 was a mostly fake fight between Britain and it's colonies for the purposes of *maintaining* the slave trade, which the native Americans abhorred. It also labeled the Native Americans 'Merciless Indian Savages' right there in the constitution text. All claims of other empires including Russia to Americas went away. \n\nSo in the same vein, the Civil War was planned by Britain to consolidate the colonies into a 'united' states under it's control. The fight wasn't over slavery, obviously, because slavery wasn't banned afterwards. If you read the 13th Amendment you can see quite plainly that the 13th Amendment awarded the right to the Federal and State governments to decide who is a slave (criminals, southern patriots, intellects, immigrants, and other unprotected classes) and force them into unpaid brutal slave labor until they die. The big difference between the federal slaves and the slaves of the pre-civil-war colonies is that the indentured servants got to build their own houses, own their own land, and be full citizens. Prisoners have no such rights.",

This fascinating exposé of the dark realities behind romanticizing the occult in our current culture reveals the naked truth about how the church has not addressed the needs of people young and old who fill the holes in their souls and spirits with evil rather than good.\n\nWeaving his personal history—including involvement in Wicca, Freemasonry, and vampirism—the author lays out the literary and cultural history of vampirism and closely analyzes the romanticized presentation of the occult in the Twilight saga.\n\nRomancing Death is a clarion call for the Church to take responsibility to be true salt and light in the world”",

If, for example, a government decided it did not want citizens buying, say, firearms, or perhaps donating funds to a political candidate, the central bank could prevent the transaction. Alternatively, it could have a permanent record of a citizen’s purchases and use these to establish a social credit score for the person,” Steele said.",

To find out what those genes are doing, researchers need tools that can manipulate their status on similarly short timescales.\n\nThat is now possible, thanks to a new technology developed at MIT and the Broad Institute that can rapidly start or halt the expression of any gene of interest simply by shining light on the cells. \n\nThe work is based on a technique known as optogenetics, which uses proteins that change their function in response to light. In this case, the researchers adapted the light-sensitive proteins to either stimulate or suppress the expression of a specific target gene almost immediately after the light comes on.”",

It wasn't a vision. D'Arc actually visited Catherine in the Crimea. Fomenko makes it clear the story was redacted and reduced to the size of just France. Clearly Catherine/Katya had said something to Jeanne that made her want to resist the Rus-Horde occuption. Think I solved this one :D",

Perhaps modern Christianity (a slave control program) is the deep-state's ultimate trick to date.  Would your claim of an original form be the same thing as (or perhaps built upon) Gnosticism?  Learning from John Lamb Lash, I view true Gnosticism to be THE anti-religion and the ultimate threat to the deep-state (aliens + human accomplices). Therefore I see the concept of Christian-Gnosticism to be an oxymoron or psyop to distract humans from truth.   But perhaps you have a different definition of the word religion than I do. Maybe you define it as a way of life. I define religion as anything based upon unquestioning faith, external salvation and higher authority.  Also anything built upon a victimhood doctrine, I view as a religion.\n\n\"Gnosticism says there is a spark of divinity in human nature, that is intelligence.  What is divine about you is not your identity or your subjective sense of what you think you are. It's your intelligence. Which is something you can prove.\" --- John Lamb Lash",

The concentration of glyphosate in plasma has increased from 2009 to 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the study’s authors determined that glyphosate concentrations in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers and Everglades Agricultural Area stormwater treatment areas were significantly higher before and during sugarcane harvesting, when glyphosate is more likely to be applied, than after harvest.”",

      "message": "Square had announced that Xenogears may not have come out in the United States due to \"sensitive religious issues\".[42][43] The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge.[44] In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of \"killing God\", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood may also have had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said \"It's dangerous\" (ヤベーよ, yabē yo). The Japanese staff found the similarity between Yahweh and yabē amusing, and, according to Honeywood, decided to call the boss Yabeh in Japanese.[45] However, in the final Japanese release of Xenogears, the boss is called Deus (デウス, deusu), so either the name was changed again at a later point or Honeywood's account is inaccurate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenogears",

Obviously the shooters have families here and aren't trafficked like she also claimed. \nFor example they've already picked up on the fact that the shooter had an online history of white supremacy. The government watches everyone's history. It's not hard for them to find someone who meets their criteria based on their Internet history and use them with their mkultra technology.\nThe TI groups she talked about are basically lab rats. They are \"nobody's\" who can't come up with any reason why they are being targeted and they are used to discredit their technology.\nIf only mass shooters reported the same symptoms then people would recognize something is going on, but since there's this whole group of people who have the symptoms without any clear reason, it discredits the program. It also attracts a lot of people who do simply just have mental illness but can't accept it. \nMy situation is \"unique\" because I don't fit into either category. There's a dark side and a light side of the chess board. Some of us actually do have compromising evidence against them and they just want us dead. I shouldn't be alive 10 times over but they couldn't kill me, although they almost have many times. \nI'm safe now but I have to lay low for awhile. \nPeople are being given a chance to wake up before they have to face the truth which some won't be able to handle.\"",

      "message": "According to Norse mythology there was a location that was very cold where frost giants came from, which I believe was the south end of Mars, the location that received the least energy in the Golden Age. These are hairy human giants who live in very cold conditions. I figure these giants were mostly white skinned. I'm pretty sure Asia and Africa had mostly giant humans up until they were wiped out in the 19th, leaving behind the smaller humans.\n\nThe Bible indicates that life and creation was created in stages, which is true according to EU theory. Since the length and nature of a 'day' was changing during the creation period, there's no way to indicate how many 'days' each period took. The word 'day' shouldn't even be used, but primitive people didn't have another word for day, only the opposite of night. Bible says 'God' had a hand in creation. If God is the planet Saturn, then by all means that would appear to be true as well, to anyone standing on the ground. Bible says man was created after land animals, which were in turn created after sea animals. That sounds right to me! Only in the most stable periods of the Golden Age did humans appear, and only after the first Human figure appeared - Adam i.e. Paratts' column [http://www.mythsarehistory.com/peratt-column-the.html](http://www.mythsarehistory.com/peratt-column-the.html)",

Now the minority who opposed war in all planes will be heard the loudest, when before there was always the possibility that the plan to destroy Russia would work. The Deep State is like the largest house of cards holding all the smaller houses of cards in place. At some point the whole thing has to come down. Will they try another plan? Of course. There's always those voices at the top saying they can solve everything if given a chance. They would want to prolong the war in Ukraine into Cold War 2 (another maybe 70 years of that) and then just try the whole Rex Bellator plan again and attack Russia. Even in that case their optimism is severely undercut by the fracturing of the USD-backed unipolar world order. Russia and China are too smart, too rich, and too well equipped to ever let Cold War 2 happen. As soon as they are allowed to trade with the west, we will finally be headed to the future utopia.",

And God gave the reason: “Because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome” (Genesis 32:28). Later, God appears to Jacob/Israel again in Bethel, reaffirms the name change, and gives him the same covenant that Abraham had received (Genesis 35:9–12). Thus the “heel-catcher” became “one who struggles with God.” It was before he met with God in Bethel that Jacob purposefully put away his idols and purified himself (verse 2).\n\n\nAfter the name change, some passages in Genesis refer to Jacob as “Jacob” (Genesis 33:1; 34:7; 35:15; 37:1) and others as “Israel” (Genesis 35:21; 37:3; 43:6; 46:1). Some have suggested that the name Jacob represents his old nature and Israel his new. That is, he is called “Jacob” when functioning in his carnal old nature, but he is called “Israel” when he is acting out of his new nature. There could be limited merit in this suggestion in some passages, and it would parallel the Christian’s experience as presented in Ephesians 4:22–24.\n\n\nIn the end, however, it is best not to make too much of the Jacob/Israel distinction, since some passages include both Jacob and Israel within the same immediate context (e.g., Genesis 37:1–3). Also, there are several psalms that use both names side by side: “Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!” (Psalm 53:6) and “He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel” (Psalm 78:5). The parallelism of the poetry identifies the names Jacob and Israel as synonymous, and both names can represent the nation as well as the individual.",

The Sacketts’ land contains wetlands, but because the wetlands are separated from the lake by a road, they argued the permit was unnecessary. It’s almost certain they would have gotten the permit had they applied, but they opted to sue instead. The court took the Sacketts’ case as an opportunity to open up a broader discussion about what exactly the Clean Water Act is meant to protect, changing the law completely and removing protections from any wetland not immediately connected to a body of water.”",

A definite causal link is shown between many peaks in all-cause mortality and rapid vaccine rollouts.

What’s the final price of this item on sale? If it’s buy X for $Y dollars, how many is each item? So many times in my life I’ve avoided getting overcharged because I could do quick math and know what an item was supposed to cost but the computer register made an error. Money I lose if I just trust the register.\n\nI use trig and geometry regularly for daily life stuff. How much soil do I need for this weirdly shaped garden bed? I don’t have to overbuy or waste time going back and forth to the store. How much paint for a certain wall space? Is the amount of servings of chili I want to make going to fit safely in the crockpot volume I have, vs just pouring in stuff and then realizing it’s gonna be too full partway there? Building anything that isn’t a perfect square requires trig to make the right angles.\n\nLack of financial literacy is one thing people are getting screwed over by every day, for example calculating interest comes from precalc. The number of people who just focus on the monthly payment (which sales people are trained to get them to do) and don’t realize just how much they will be paying for stuff over the life of a loan keeps people poorer than they need to be. Car/student/home loans and credit card companies all benefit from the consumer being as ignorant as possible about money. On the positive side, investing (even small amounts) compounds a lot over time and can make a BIG difference in financial security later if the person starts young. But many people don’t know that, so they think contributing $50 or $100 a month from a job is pointless. Running a business? There’s a reason business calculus is offered in college, it’s very useful.\n\nI could go on and on. I’m not a mathematician and Rob will tell you, I used to hate math. But I cannot deny its usefulness.\n\n[Ari Asulin](https://www.facebook.com/protricity?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDEwNTMyODI4MTA4Mzk4Nl8xMDM3MDg1MzM3NTA5NzYw\u0026__cft__[0]=AZXi_iwX8X1v13MqsxzIKtshO5rJMp4eqsumHPOYElklgBHd-vqhBIhnJJCDKcciIKJfSKTUnsV-jvY6aQL0TKBnaCYzIfDRtWk2e_QIodYkfKvExb67O4VVKtw0JQRowb8\u0026__tn__=R]-R)\n\n[Bronwyn Bacon](https://www.facebook.com/bronwyn.horton?__cft__[0]=AZXi_iwX8X1v13MqsxzIKtshO5rJMp4eqsumHPOYElklgBHd-vqhBIhnJJCDKcciIKJfSKTUnsV-jvY6aQL0TKBnaCYzIfDRtWk2e_QIodYkfKvExb67O4VVKtw0JQRowb8\u0026__tn__=R]-R) For your examples, I really haven't seen anyone in the last 20 or so years do any calculations themselves when shopping. They tend to approximate, and the art of approximate is NOT taught in school. I wish it was, but it is absolutely not. So students have a choice to use the tools as taught to them, and the vast majority choose not to. Again, the math has failed us. It doesn't matter what you EXPECT children to do with their education, it only matters what they ACTUALLY do, and they don't use basic arithmetic.\n\nAgain trig and geometry are not used in labor, only in architechture design. With all the workers I've worked with, all their measurements do not involve trig calculations at all. Your weirdly shaped soil bed example is a rare and extreme scenario, so please be honest about that.\n\nFinancial literacy is an excuse to justify usury. We will, in our lifetime, see an end to usury entirely outside of competitive practice. No more calculating student loan, home loan, car loan interest. No more loans at all. You could say nah it'll never happen, but that would just be rooting for this financial usury nightmare to go on indefinitely. People like me will make sure it doesn't.\n\nNow, most of the poeple in my life are poorly educated and poor in general, and I can tell you frankly that the reality you live in does not apply to them. To the people in my life, education chewed them up and spit them out, and they are now rotting as a result. Maybe you can come up with an equation to make them feel better Bacon\n\n[Ari Asulin](https://www.facebook.com/protricity?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDEwNTMyODI4MTA4Mzk4Nl8xMDMxNTUxNzc4MDk5MzIw\u0026__cft__[0]=AZXi_iwX8X1v13MqsxzIKtshO5rJMp4eqsumHPOYElklgBHd-vqhBIhnJJCDKcciIKJfSKTUnsV-jvY6aQL0TKBnaCYzIfDRtWk2e_QIodYkfKvExb67O4VVKtw0JQRowb8\u0026__tn__=R]-R)\n\nan addendum on trigonometry (which I hate if you can't tell): It is used to convince us of false sciences. For example, Astrology, the entire field, fails to take into account light refraction in space when calculating distances - insisting utterly that light travels in direct lines at 'constant' speeds and can be therefore used to calculate precise locations of distant stars up to 'light years'. Without bothering to try to debunk this false science I'll just remind once again that people like Pythagorus and Isacc Newton were deeply religious and ran CULTS that lasted into modern day. [https://www.thecollector.com/cult-of-pythagoras/](https://www.thecollector.com/cult-of-pythagoras/?fbclid=IwAR3uZXdxfv4F5_9f6wnTcNMwMdFi3geG8hNaMGA7wHB7Or2Km4Lb7m2eM-A)\n\nThis isn't science, nor is it knowledge. It's ideological warfare inflicted on innocent children.",

Or again refer me to your existing content.\n\nRe MAGA: I guess you mean Trump-ish MAGA?  I've briefly read over your notes on Trump, but I am skeptical there is any good in him. At one time I hoped that there were some good people in high places in major western military forces, but I've learned to not hope for anything and assumed for a couple of years that any \"white hat\" talk was controlled opposition psyops intended to disempower us.",

According to the Thornhil model, the Suns are hollow and convert light elements to heavy ones on the surface (fusion) that then drop to the core of the Sun which isn't as hot. Inside there they sorta boil around getting hit by epic lightning strikes carving out the initial mountains. After a while the planetoids get too big and the Sun ejects them from its body. They fall into the outer solar system, where there are thousands of dead planets and unborn planetoids. At some point one of these lucky planetoids is gobbled up by a Brown Dwarf like Saturn and then plugged back into the Sun. At this point the planetoid comes to life in a 'Golden Age' as a planet and the first animals are created - not from DNA, but completely from scratch based on the scaled down energy patterns already appearing in the sky (like the first man in Mayan Myth, or Adam in the Bible). You can see where they got the idea that God created the animals. Not God, plasma.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Cqi9Unajriv/",

The former Secretary General of the Party of China, Hu Jintao, was forcibly taken out of the hall.\n\nThe footage shows how two stewards approach Hu and escort him to the exit. The politician only looks around in confusion, but does not find support. Hu Jintao's departure was not explained in the party.\n\nHu Jintao stands for maintaining good US relations, and is also an opponent of a forceful solution to the Taiwan issue. Such a conclusion from the hall \"under the handles\" is probably a symbolic point in Hu's political career. Connected to Taiwan",

My guess is the french had superior air power, airships even, and sound cannons. They were planning to destroy the Kremlin to win the Crusades and the Russians knew it. They took all the books from the Kremlin and burned it down. This is the main reason Fomenko has all that alternate literature today. It's also why we've been trying to destroy Russia with Hitler and Zelensky\nSo my guess is the 1812 war was a lot like the Vietnam war (58k american troops died) - westerners invading the East with superior technology and failing to meet all of their goals. In the case of Napoleon, his army was apparently so undisciplined they were easily placed in danger. I can see exactly why they lost so many troops. The moment N lost the Deep State saw no choice but to initiate the Great Reset. Notice they did NOT destroy france. They did destroy siberia. So they had to still bet on their Protestant plan, but win the religious war in more artificial ways (i.e. space lazer)",

For the same reason Trump did Operation Warp Speed - to beat the Deep State at the planned **mandatory** vaccine role out in all countries. It would have been trivially easy to convince each country of the need for a mandatory poison pill vaccine rollout during a deadly outbreak. They had a real version (i.e. deadly covid that spreads quickly). Op Warpspeed called the bluff. Deep state had a choice to release the deadly virus which op warp speed would have analyzed and provided a real vaccine for (essentially like a rabies vaccine). Or they could just wait until Trump was out of office and WW2 started (around 2021) to roll out their own deadly vaccine (with no deadly outbreak to match). They chose the latter because they knew they could control that future. However, now that the vaccine has been proven ineffective towards the non-deadly version of covid (i.e. fake), there's no way to sell the population on mandatory - and that's planet wide. So the plan has been utterly foiled, and it was fool proof plan, so frankly there was only 1 way. Real life ended up being a lot like the plot of Avengers Infinity Wars.\n3. Putin knows there is a real virus and has to play this game carefully - essentially playing dumb until certain things are disclosed to the public. It's again, the only way to fight a plan like this. So if you want to know about the real virus and what it would have done to the population, I'd refer you to the #zombies-vampires channel. But here's a video that convinced me: \nhttps://www.paradigmthreat.net/genocide/vaccine/ussr_zombie_outbreak.mp4",

Not very many people have family members with multiple fake identities that you can't trace. There were also stories my family told about a conspiracy which I suspected was connected to their identities. You could say curiosity killed the cat because I googled too many things which triggered them and that's when I was attacked. Nearly a year of constant torture until I could no longer function and was nearly dead from sleep deprivation. \nAs most people know the medical community has long been involved in mkultra, especially when it comes to medication which in the governments Mkultra documents they even admit that medicine to cause amnesia is essential. I was put to sleep with medicine for several days and then given their cocktail of antipsychotics which I only took for about a month. Regardless between the trauma, medication and fear I forgot most of the torture and things that were said and done and I was too afraid to ever look into my family again. Over time I completely forgot what it was even about. Then I was triggered. Realized shit was going to hit the fan, packed up my family and got the hell \"away from the face of the beast.\" Aka the United States Air force. Moved completely across the country to the middle of nowhere and found help. Put the pieces together and realized why they hate me.\"",

Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found that glial cells not only come alive, but also increase in size and grow arm-like appendages hours after a person dies. Study author Jeffrey Loeb, head of neurology and rehabilitation at the UIC’s College of Medicine, said the findings weren’t “too surprising” as the glial cells are inflammatory “and their job is to clean things up after brain injuries like oxygen deprivation or stroke.”\n\n“Most studies assume that everything in the brain stops when the heart stops beating, but this is not so,” Loeb said in a statement. “Our findings will be needed to interpret research on human brain tissues.

A huge Ufo was seen very near the Brooklyn bridge on the Manhattan side, extricating a woman from her 12th floor apartment, the woman floating in the air …. With 3 Greys beside her! The Greys were floating too under a blue light emanating from the craft. The craft took her and sped and dived in the Hudson river ….\nThere’s A Lot more to the story…\nHave you heard about it? \nI have Budd Hopkins’book on what happened coz Linda got in touch with Budd. From what I understand this was 1 of many more abductions that night (!!!) \n",

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) finds U.S. pregnant women experience frequent exposure to environmental pollutants that pose serious health risks to both mother and newborn. Many known pollutants (i.e., heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyl, and pesticides) are chemicals that can move from the mother to the developing fetus at higher exposure rates. Hence, prenatal exposure to these chemicals may increase the prevalence of birth-related health consequences like natal abnormalities and learning/developmental disabilities.”",

The latter event crystallized what had been happening for years, the Bank’s steady retreat from ordinary commercial operations and its metamorphosis into a body acting in the public interest having been overseen and accelerated by long-serving Governor Montagu Norman, who worked in that role from 1920 to 1944.\n\nOn February 14 the Bank of England Act 1946, which came into effect on March 1 that year, took all the stock of the Bank of England into public ownership in order to: “make provision with respect to the relations between the Treasury, the Bank of England and other banks.” \n\nWith this action the Bank of England, founded in 1694 by (somewhat ironically) the Scot William Paterson , from the outset set up to lend to the government, became an arm of that government rather than an ally. In some ways the bank had already been a quasi-governmental body, given the monopoly over issuing bank notes in England and Wales (though not Scotland and Northern Ireland). No change as dramatic would happen to the organisation until May 1997 , when another Labour government decided to give the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street the power to set interest rates in Britain, removing that power from political hands.\n",

I have connections in music and can come up with a sound track. https://paradigmthreat.net/@articles/ech-in-time",

Pretty amazing.**\n\n*Beowulf* begins with the story of [Hrothgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrothgar \"Hrothgar\"), who constructed the great hall, Heorot, for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife [Wealhtheow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealhtheow \"Wealhtheow\"), and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a [troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll \"Troll\")\\-like monster said to be descended from the biblical [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain \"Cain\"), is pained by the sounds of joy.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-23) Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\n\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-24)\n\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be Grendel's equal.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-25) When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-26) Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-27) Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-28) Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-29) Beowulf displays \"the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp\" for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf#cite_note-30)",

You mentioned how that at an early age you could sense that something was fundamentally wrong with the Judaism beliefs in your family. I could relate to that and you captured my attention straight away. From the age of 5 to about 8 my parents sent me to modern christian \"Sunday school\", and listened to many of the stories in the old testament, despite the things that sounded good and moral, there was a lot of bad stuff in there which never sat right with me. Something seemed very wrong with sacrifice, original sin, suffering, punishment, external salvation, never questioning, loving enemies and a god that commanded killing innocent humans. Then much later in life I learn about the Semitic Talmud's interpretation of the old testament and that sealed the deal.  It's impressive that the deep state players pulled it off.

In addition, due to the turret ventilation systems sucking in fumes, German crews would sometimes be forced to abandon their vehicle: this proved particularly effective against inexperienced crews who, on seeing smoke inside the turret, would assume their tank had caught fire.

The other world is Cocoon, an artificial safe haven for humanity which hovers above the surface of Pulse and is also at the mercy of the fal'Cie. Here, the governing body Sanctum does everything in its power to turn its people against Pulse by convincing them the planet below is more or less a version of hell. Cocoon's anti-Pulse convictions are so strong that any contact with the planet and its inhabitants are met with severe repercussions such as exile or a Purge of any Cocoon section that has the misfortune of discovering something from Pulse in its backyard.",

They have tremendous pull. Le Pen was facing Macron after all.\n\n\nAnd on the other hand straight up Central Bankers and/or investment bankers as candidates and presidents and Prime Ministers. Macron is a good example as an investment banker. And in Italy Mario Draghi as Prime Minister who was the head of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Both Macron and Draghi are Covid-Great Reset extremists. \n\nThe population of Europe is being taken from a Left Right Paradigm to a Communitarianism style new matrix in between bandit abject orangutan Nationalists on the one hand and money managers, bankers on the other  \n",

We attempted to overcome these biases by adjusting for the variables known to affect the risk of severe COVID-19. However, some sources of bias might not have been measured or corrected adequately, such as social dissimilarities and different behaviour patterns between participants who chose early on to receive the bivalent booster vaccine and those who decided not to. The main demographic groups in Israel (general Jewish population, ultra-Orthodox Jewish population, and Arab population) also manifest different health-related behavioural patterns. Bivalent booster vaccine uptake was significantly lower in the minority Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups than in the generally Jewish population. However, our analysis adjusted for these subpopulations to overcome such possible bias. Our analysis included only the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent mRNA vaccine, as it was the primary supplier in Israel during the study period. Generalisation of these results to other bivalent booster vaccines should be done with caution. Evaluation of adverse events and safety data reports was beyond the scopy of this study, as this would require an alternative and designated study design. Future studies are still needed to assess the short-term and long-term safety of the bivalent mRNA booster vaccine in real-world settings. However, preliminary short-term safety results published by the CDC have shown a comprehensive safety profile for the bivalent booster and reassured that adverse events reported after a bivalent booster dose are consistent with those reported after monovalent doses.24 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00122-6/fulltext",

If you’ve watched any of Ye’s recent podcasts or interviews He’s wearing his bummy clothes and showing his face. He’s tired and not trying to hide from anyone anymore, which is clear by him going on so many interviews and podcasts recently speaking his “truth” not this masked clone Kanye. It’s a clear attack on Kanye and this should’t be laughed off. Pay attention to his next appearances where he isn’t “masked” Kanye, it’s simply not him",

Today the term Israelite is redacted with the definition specifically limited to a race of Semitic-speaking tribes in the middle east, but in eastern literature the term refers to the Religious Crusaders of the Rus-Horde Empire who destroyed Jerusalem #1 and rebuilt #2 as the Kremlin in Moscow (circa 1567 CE) in defiance of the Deep State (a.k.a. God's will). Christ's teachings were seen as blasphemy against the church he was punished with The Crucifixion. The revenge Crusade that followed was also an act of rebellion against the church. This religious schism between east and west became a social catalyst that would eventually lead to the rapid creation of a vast Eastern Tartarian Rus-Horde Empire which was remembered, among many other names, as the land of Israel. Throughout history, the Jews (those most loyal to the church's authority) and Israelites (those acting in defiance of the church's authority) were often on opposite sides of military and religious conflicts.",

In order to start a war with an enemy that doesn't want war you have to militarize them in preparation. That's what the British did to America. By controlling Russia's military secrets, the west prevented them from building real weapons like lazers, while controlling all technology that comes from war research, like airplanes, computers, space travel etc. There's a reason Russians still can't land a probe on the moon.

      "message": "\"But the other important part of the decision concerned whether the injunction would prevent holders of LBC tokens from selling them. On this issue, the judge held as follows:As for third-party holders of LBC, the SEC has not argued in this case that they could violate the injunction merely by purchasing or selling LBC. Indeed, the SEC has expressly stated that it “is not seeking an order prohibiting all third parties from buying or selling LBC.” . . . Given the SEC’s litigation posture, it suffices to say that merely holding LBC or purchasing it for consumptive purposes is insufficient to bring third parties within the purview of [the injunction]. Instead, third parties would need to act in concert with LBRY in order to be exposed to a risk of being held in contempt of the injunction order.Furthermore, because the SEC did not seek relief against third-party purchasers of LBC, the court declined both LBRY’s and the amici’s invitation to rule on whether LBC is itself a security. Since that issue had not been litigated, the court took no position on whether the registration requirement applies to secondary market offerings of LBC by persons or entities that are not subject to the injunction.With respect to the amount of the civil penalty, LBRY argued for a nominal penalty because it did not act with scienter and entered the cryptocurrency market during a time of great uncertainty as to the regulatory requirements. The SEC argued for the maximum statutory amount for a first-tier violation ($111,614) because LBRY’s unregistered offerings were egregious and continued after this lawsuit was filed. The court agreed with the SEC and said that, because LBRY’s misconduct continued after the SEC’s position on the registration requirement became clear, its violation was more egregious than a simple unregistered offering. It ordered a fine of $111,614. https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1f7b1ae2-5845-4299-a38a-90b6599cbd22",

I was trying to talk to my Grandmother (who told me she believed 9/11 was faked, wow!) and he cut me off. Anyway I was trying to figure out what kind of person he was later, growing up hearing he's this genius that worked for Honeywell and retired very early. So I found this \n\"There is another key reason why Honeywell workers, aware of what the company manufactures, fail to protest. No single employee, even on a high level, is willing to acknowledge that just by performing his job on a day-to-day basis, he is participating in a criminal organization. This is far too conceptual a notion for an individual to come to terms with on his own, lacking the impetus of a Honeywell. And though many demonstrations have taken place and much has been written, no such movement yet exists. There is also the official Honeywell position on anti-personnel weapons, the impact of which inside the corporation should not be underestimated. In short, it expounds the theory that American soldiers in the field deserve and require all possible support. https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/2/8/manufacturing-death-pbdburing-the-years-of/",

There shouldn't be some unique scenario in our solar system that caused some kind of abrupt shift. Instead, we can explain every shift, why they happened, and why they always happen as part of a natural planet birthing process. Furthermore, I believe asteroids rarely ever hit planets. The idea that craters on Moon or Earth came from asteroid collisions has been successfully debunked by simple observation - all craters are round. So we can rule out any catastrophic collisions in the past entirely. The effect of some passing asteroid could not possibly match the effects of interplanetary discharge in the Golden/Dark ages",

      "message": "🇷🇺🇺🇦 The Kremlin was aware of the plans of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to take advantage of the arrival of the IAEA mission and carry out an amphibious landing in order to try to seize the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and make statements for days that it was Russian special forces.  Under ideal conditions for the work of the DRG, they calculated the task of taking the mission itself hostage and keeping the nuclear power plant under mines, making demands for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops to the territory of Crimea.\n\n Boris Johnson brought the plan of operation and some of the instructors with him as a demobilization chord of his premiership, but if the GUR was successful, he would have refused to transfer power, referring to an international emergency threatening a catastrophe on a planetary scale.  At the moment, 47 DRG fighters have been destroyed, three have been taken prisoner (!), Two are in serious condition between life and death.  A group of 12 people is blocked on three sides and cut off from the water and boats, by 15:00 CTO will be over.  Zelensky's statement on this situation is expected in the late afternoon, the head of the IAEA Mission has already been notified of the situation, as well as UN Secretary General Guterres.  The operation was coordinated by MI6 officers from their headquarters in the suburbs of Kyiv.\n All 64 DRGs have recently completed training in the UK and traveled from Warsaw to Odessa on 29 August.",

What I'm wondering is 1. if their current plan for control fails, then why won't they re-use their weapon and go ahead and commence another cataclysm and reset us? 2.  Why wouldn't they use their other weapon, the financial system which they've created, and collapse us economically and beyond conventional imagination?\n\nI admit I've not yet found your article or video regarding the alien controls over our markets.  I just presume they have many options to collapse our credit addicted economies at any time they choose.\n\nIt is inspiring to consider where Earth humans would be in terms of quality of life, if left alone to evolve without the deep state interference.",

      "message": "Debating by email \n\"There are times when 'capture' could occur, but each event follows a cyclic stage in the lifespan of a solar system from birth to death. The parents (Saturn and Sun) were already there, but when they finally combined they gave 'birth' to all of the planets and moons that would make up our solar system. This can't happen if planets are already inhabiting our solar system. So the birth process can only start after the last solar system has died, with all the planets going cold and drifting to the outer solar system beyond the fake planet pluto. We are now finding huge planets there. Possibly we will find signs of ancient civilization there as well. However, that civilization did not influence the current one.\n\nOur solar system started its new life with a Big Bang. Russians think Big Bangs occur local to solar systems, while Western scientists insist Big Bang happened 13.8 billion years ago and affected the entire universe, which is assinine and unsupported by any observation. After Saturn connected to the Sun it exploded (big bang) and caused the Golden Age to start. That age provided a high amplitude energy field around the system so powerful no invading alien could possibly penetrate it known as the Firmament or Absu. Just like an egg protects a new life, the firmament made of Saturn's plasma layers prevented any interference from other solar systems or ancient life from dead planets in our system.\n\nIn this moment of Big Bang, Saturn split into Jupiter Venus, Neptune and Uranus, and each layer of Saturn 'captured' moons and planetoids from the afterbirth of Brown Dwarf saturn. According to Mythology, planetoids were captured between Jupiter and Saturn in a major War of the Gods lasting centuries. Later, the largest planetoid - Earth - captured a large moon. Mars was also able to capture some crappy looking moons. Mercury and Venus were so aloof and unpredictable that they failed to capture any moons at all. Venus is NOT a rock, it's a plasmoid planet; NASA lies etc. \n\nSo my point is capture does happen, but never does it happen between systems. More to the point, the axial tilts were set AFTER the golden age, and not before. So no capture caused the axial tilts to be fixed. \"",

Two months after discussing this data, she said vaccinated people “don’t carry the virus” and “don’t get sick.” In a congressional hearing, after it became clear people were able to get infected with COVID even after receiving the vaccine, she defended her original statements by claiming it was true at the time she said it — namely, for the strands we were dealing with in early 2021.\n\nWe now know that was not true and that Walensky herself knew it was not true.”",

      "message": "*Q: What is the Deep State?*\nThe Deep State is a clandestine 'royal bloodline' that imposes systems of control over other humans in all towns, cities, states and countries within their influence. On April 27, 1961 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n```For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations```\n\nWhom then are the beneficiaries of global conspiracy? Often in a controlled-opposition environment, you'll find amateur conspiracy theorists railing against a particular race, religion, or creed. You'll see conspirator accusations thrown at 'The British', 'The Jews', non-human ETs, dimensional demons, or even 'The Devil' himself. It's important to understand the Deep State is loyal to no race, religion, or creed, but rather only to their family. If you see any corporate shills like David Icke accusing an entire race or alien species of a conspiracy, just remember, they are just being racist.",

Unfortunately after all this time, he has failed to whistleblow or leak anything of any significance (Wikileaks was actually a dangerous honeypot). He cannot be compared to the likes of Daniel Ellsberg as Daniel published EVERYTHING HE HAD and was consquential to ending the Vietnam War. Assange is instead a Controlled Opposition Agent. He leaked the 9/11 pager messages which in many minds ended the investigation into the real events. His Ecuadorian embassy hoax makes London and Ecuador look good geopolitically progressive and compliant with international law, but behind the scenes this was a screen for taking advantage of a 30 year civil war in Ecuador started by the CIA and finally forcing the farmers out of their lands.

      "message": "'Wage-slavery to a handful of multimillionaires': Vladimir Lenin's Letter to American Workers https://www.rt.com/russia/591074-vladimir-lenin-letter-to-american-workers/\nComrades! A Russian Bolshevik who took part in the 1905 Revolution, and who lived in your country for many years afterwards, has offered to convey my letter to you. I have accepted his proposal all the more gladly because just at the present time the American revolutionary workers have to play an exceptionally important role as uncompromising enemies of American imperialism — the freshest, strongest and latest in joining in the world-wide slaughter of nations for the division of capitalist profits. At this very moment, the American multimillionaires, these modern slaveowners, have turned an exceptionally tragic page in the bloody history of bloody imperialism by giving their approval — whether direct or indirect, open or hypocritically concealed, makes no difference — to the armed expedition launched by the brutal Anglo-Japanese imperialists for the purpose of throttling the first socialist republic.\n\nThe history of modern, civilized America opened with one of those great, really liberating, really revolutionary wars of which there have been so few compared to the vast number of wars of conquest which, like the present imperialist war, were caused by squabbles among kings, landowners or capitalists over the division of usurped lands or ill-gotten gains. That was the war the American people waged against the British robbers who oppressed America and held her in colonial slavery, in the same way as these “civilized” bloodsuckers are still oppressing and holding in colonial slavery hundreds of millions of people in India, Egypt, and all parts of the world.",

      "message": "\"An expert hired by Israel’s government to help analyze COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports warned officials in a closed-door meeting to carefully present the data to the public because of litigation concerns, according to leaked video of the meeting.  Dr. Mati Berkovitch, the expert, said that the phenomenon of rechallenge found by the team turned causal links between the events and Pfizer’s vaccine “from possible to definitive,” according to the video, which was reviewed by The Epoch Times.  Rechallenge means investigators find an adverse event worsens or reoccurs with subsequent vaccine doses. Causality means a vaccine is determined to be the cause of the adverse event.  Because of the rechallenge, “we will also have to think medicolegal,” Berkovitch said. “Why medicolegal? Because there were quite a few phenomena, we said, ‘okay, it exists, there is a report, but still get vaccinated.’  “I mean, you have to think about how to write it and how to present it correctly, so there won’t be lawsuits after that,” he said.  Berkovitch imagined a person who suffered an adverse event following vaccination.  “‘Wait, wait, wait, you said that everything will pass and you need to get vaccinated. And now look what happened to me,'” he said, pretending to be the person. “‘The phenomenon continues.’ We need to think about the medicolegal aspect before we move forward, Emilia.” https://www.theepochtimes.com/israeli-officials-were-warned-to-present-covid-19-vaccine-safety-data-carefully-to-avoid-lawsuits_4757547.html",

      "message": "Question: After your statement about the possibility of a nuclear war, of the third world war, the whole world is asking: is there a real risk of that happening?\n\nSergey Lavrov: It looks like by the whole world you mean Western media and politicians. This is not the first time I note how skillfully the West twists what Russia’s representatives say. I was asked about the threats that are currently growing and about how real the risk of the third world war is. I answered literally the following: Russia has never ceased its efforts to reach agreements that would guarantee the prevention of a nuclear war. In recent years, it was Russia who has persistently proposed to its American colleagues that we repeat what Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan did in 1987: adopt a statement reaffirming that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, and therefore it must never be unleashed.\n\nWe failed to convince the Trump Administration, because it had its own ideas on this issue. However, the Biden Administration agreed to our proposal. In June 2021, at a meeting between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and US President Joseph Biden in Geneva a statement was adopted on the inadmissibility of a nuclear war. Let me stress: this was done at our initiative.\n\nIn January 2022, five permanent members of the UN Security Council adopted a similar statement at the highest level, also at our initiative: there can be no winners in a nuclear war. It must never be unleashed. In order to achieve this goal, President Vladimir Putin proposed convening a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This proposal was supported by our Chinese colleagues and France. The United States and the United Kingdom, which always defers to it, are holding back this important event for the time being.\n\nAfter I said this, I urged everyone to exercise utmost caution not to escalate the existing threats. I was referring to the statement made by President Vladimir Zelensky in February that it had been a mistake for Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons and it was necessary to acquire them again. There was also a statement made by the leadership of Poland about their readiness to deploy American nuclear weapons on their territory, and much more.",

      "message": "Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force University of Engineering in Xian has made progress towards developing a new hypersonic weapon capable of engaging small mobile targets precisely enough to hit a moving car, according to team leader Yang Xiaogong. He stressed that “important progress” had been made towards solving the primary issue of pinpointing moving targets at extreme speeds, which has long been considered near unsolvable. The team highlighted in a paper for the Infrared and Laser Engineering peer reviewed journal that the speed of hypersonic weapons, which travel at at least five times the speed of sound, means even very small positioning or guidance errors can result in missiles striking very far off target. The infrared signature of a car sized moving target “constitutes just a few pixels without detailed information such as shape, texture and structure,” which makes identification and tracking “extremely difficult.” A further issue is the fact that infrared sensors require cold environments which makes them very difficult to integrate onto missiles which that are several thousand degrees hot - as is normal when travelling at hypersonic speeds. Nevertheless, the team expressed confidence that such a missile could be developed by 2025. (MWM)",

Every time this kind of event happens, they have a chance to move the chess pieces around and redefine reality, taking away natural sovereignty and replacing it with a myriad of obscure laws. On the historic legal paperwork (i.e. blockchain) all the sovereign citizens eventually died and 'abandoned' their children to orphanage facilities who become property of the crown. Researchers of the 19th century reset point out that the reset cities were repopulated by orphan trains, rather than by complete families. At some point during the reset, all the adults were killed leaving behind endless children (kinda like in the Maui fire). Those children didn't know who they were, only the name of their dead parents. Everyone started being called 'son of __' or '_son'. They were also named by their taught profession, Weaver, Webb, Webber and Webster etc. So here in the 20th century every last one of us is property of the Deep State i.e. 4th Rome and nobody has a family history that can be traced beyond 200 years",

After the failure of Luna-25 earlier this year, it has been suggested that monopolization under the modern Roscosmos, as opposed to the internal competition of the Soviet era, may have been one of the reasons for the decline in technical standards. As is well known, the strategic decision to have a double factory and a double design bureau for every aspect of new technology, especially those significant for defense, was made in the late Stalinist period and then developed in the Khrushchev period. This was the case not only in the rocket and space industry, but also, for example, in the nuclear industry. Memoirs show that competition between the parallel Soviet nuclear centers in Sarov and Snezhinsk was also extremely fierce, sometimes accompanied by bureaucratic intrigue. The same was true in aviation, first in the military and then in civil aviation, between the design bureaus of Tupolev, Ilyushin, Yakovlev and others. Due to the greater openness of aviation issues, it is clear that in such a situation the competition of design ideas was replaced by competition for administrative resources available to a given chief designer. As a result, many promising developments, such as those by Vladimir Myasishchev or Robert Bartini, were never realized.\"",

We see the same thing today with the renaming of Artyomovsk to Bahamut - that giant fish the earth sits upon in the cryptic OT",

Now that that's been accomplished, they can release a *symbiotic* disease like MonkeyPox which will feed off the low immunity + high toxicity in the herd.\nI still think we'll see the depopulation event happen to some scale. It seems nothing can stop a plan like this. Geopolitical actors know this and are just fighting for who gets to be in charge after.\nI'm also starting to suspect a very devious aspect to stage 1. If I'm right, there has **not** been a major increase in vaccine injuries in the last 2 years. Not. These injections are not designed to have side effects this early anyway. So what I'm saying is - all the **evidence** put out by VAERS is designed to convince people the vaccines were **safe**, and that the conspiracy theorists are reading it wrong because they are impatient and untrained. For all the evidence I've read and redistributed, none of it was a slam-dunk. I think the only real evidence we had were the individual testimonies, they seem to be 100% legit and by the millions. Different categories of humans are being systematically ignored while they are culled. It's hard to prove any of it",

Watch this short clip from a 1945 newsreel and you cannot see any difference between the U.S. fire carpet bombing 62 cities directly before Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nNo Remaining Radiation in Nuked Cities. Why?\n Burchett’s reference to the atomic plague immediately moved the War Department into action. At first they ordered Burchett to leave Japan. Then the camera he had used in Hiroshima mysteriously disappeared. The US occupation authorities claimed that Burchett had been taken in by Japanese propaganda about radiation. [20]\nThey decided to let him stay in Japan and opted instead to deal with his charges about atomic sickness by simply denying that radiation had caused any problems. As a result, a New York Times reporter who had a week earlier reported witnessing sickness and death due to the lingering effects of the atomic bomb simply reversed the truth.\nHe now reported that according to the head of the US atomic mission to Japan the bomb had not produced any “dangerous, lingering radioactivity.” [21] The Washington Post uncritically noted that the atomic mission staff had been unable to find any Japanese person suffering from radiation sickness. [22]  (Source)\nNow the fact that both cities are flourishing with no evidence of prolonged rates of cancer or radioactivity, which should be increasing yearly due to the nuke bombing 75 years ago.\n“For all other cancers, incidence increase did not appear until around ten years after the attacks. The increase was first noted in 1956 and soon after tumor registries were started in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki to collect data on the excess cancer risks caused by the radiation exposure.\nThe most thorough study regarding the incidence of solid cancer (meaning cancer that is not leukemia) was conducted by a team led by Dale L. Preston of Hirosoft International Corporation and published in 2003.\n\nThe study estimated the attributable rate of radiation exposure to solid cancer to be significantly lower than that for leukemia—10.7%.\n\nAccording to the RERF, the data corroborates the general rule that even if someone is exposed to a barely survivable whole-body radiation dose, the solid cancer risk will not be more than five times greater than the risk of an unexposed individual.\n\n….One of the most immediate concerns after the attacks regarding the future of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki was what health effects the radiation would have on the children of survivors conceived after the bombings.\n\nSo far, no radiation-related excess of disease has been seen in the children of survivors, though more time is needed to be able to know for certain.\n\nIn general, though, the healthfulness of the new generations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki provide confidence that, like the oleander flower, the cities will continue to rise from their past destruction.\n\nPerhaps most reassuring of this is the view of the cityscapes themselves. Among some there is the unfounded fear that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still radioactive; in reality, this is not true.”",

Again the people shouted 'Yahu!' and\n\nlifted the heavy weight. They repeated this until the sky was sufficiently high.\" Shelton says that\nthe word \"Yahu\" is used today when some heavy object like a large canoe is being lifted.\nIt is easy to recognize the origin of this legend. Clouds of dust and gases enveloped the earth for\na long time; it seemed that the sky had descended low. The earth groaned repeatedly because of\nthe severe twisting and dislocation it had experienced. Only slowly and gradually did the clouds\nlift themselves from the ground.\nThe clouds that enveloped the Israelites in the desert, the trumpetlike sounds that they heard at\nMount Sinai, and the gradual lifting of the clouds in the years of the Shadow of Death are the\nsame elements that we find in this Indian legend.\nBecause the same elements can be recognized in very different settings, we can affirm that there\nwas no borrowing from one people by another. A common experience created the stories, so\ndissimilar at first, and so much alike on second thought.\nThe story of the end of the world, as related by the Pawnee Indians, has an important content. It\nwas written down8 from the mouth of an old Indian:\n\"We are told by the old people that the Morning Star ruled over all the minor gods in the\nheavens. . . .

The study reveals that over 100 million Americans are burdened with medical debt, placing a significant financial strain on their lives. Further analysis of the data reveals that approximately one-fourth of American adults carrying this debt owe more than $5,000.\n\nWhat makes this issue even more concerning is the fact that it is not primarily driven by a lack of insurance coverage. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of people grappling with medical debt are not uninsured. Instead, it is the problem of being underinsured that is prevalent. Many people have health insurance plans that do not offer sufficient coverage, leaving them vulnerable to high out-of-pocket expenses and accumulating medical debt.”",

There were no interest rates on loans, the banks were state-owned, the loan of citizens by law 0%.\n3. Kadafi promised not to buy a house for his parents until everyone in Libya owns a home. Gadafi's father died in a tent during his reign.\n4. All newlywed couples in Libya received 60,000 dinars from the government and because of that they bought their own apartments and started their families.\n5. Education and medical treatment in Libya are free. Before Gaddafi there were only 25% readers, 83% during his reign\n6. If Libyans wanted to live on a farm, they received free household appliances, seeds and livestock.\n7. If they cannot receive treatment in Libya, the state would fund them +2300$ accommodation and travel for treatment abroad.\n8. If you buy a car, the government finances 50% of the price.\n9. The price of gasoline became $ 0.14 per liter.\n10. Libya had no external debt, and reserves were $ 150 billion (now frozen worldwide)\n11. Since some Libyans can't find jobs after school, the government will pay the average salary when they can't find a job.\n12. Part of oil sales in Libya are directly linked to the bank accounts of all citizens.\n13. The mother who gave birth to the child will receive $5 000\n14. 40 loaves of bread cost $0.15.\n15. 25% of Libyans had all Ilisna diplomas.\n16. Kadafi has implemented the world's biggest irrigation project known as the \"BIG MAN PROJECT\" to ensure water availability in the desert.\nIf this is called \"DICTATORSHIP\", I wonder what democracy is?",

AquaBounty, a land-based salmon producer, officially broke ground April 20 for its 479,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility that will produce 10,000 metric tons of Atlantic salmon every year.\n\nAccording to AquaBounty CEO Sylvia Wulf, the Pioneer site was chosen over 250 other possible locations around the country. Cost of the project will be in the $290 million to $320 million range and bring between 100 and 150 new jobs to the area. She added that commercial stocking of salmon eggs will begin in late 2023.”",

NVIC stated: “We submit this public comment to respectfully express our on-going deep concern regarding the lack of attention to vaccine safety and informed consent protections in recommendations made by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), in this case, the HPV Working Group. The HPV Vaccination Work Group Draft Report and Recommendations appears to have been rushed to public comment. The public was given only 15 days to respond and public comments were limited to three pages. This very short notice has hampered the public’s ability to comment and there has been a lack transparency in that comments received on the Federal Register have been blocked from public view. Stakeholder engagement on the draft report and recommendations also appears to have been limited to those in agreement with the federal HPV vaccination schedule with no representation of parent organization stakeholders concerned about vaccine safety and informed consent issues”\n``` \nhttps://www.nvic.org/NVIC/media/LegacySite/pdf/NVAC/nvic-written-comment-2018-hpv-draft-rec.pdf",

      "message": "1660 - 1672 C.E. - **Deep State** targets independent banks\n\nPart of the plan for any religious-military conquest is the issuing of a centralized currency and usury-based banking system to all conquered regions. In the height of the Russian Empire, the port of London was a major center for international trade. During the Reformation, many rich merchants would store their gold in London. Agents of the **Deep State** knew the financial independence of London goldsmiths must be crushed in order to create a centralized banking system under their control.\n\nBy 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne following years of civil war where an estimated 200k Britons died. Citing interest rates on gold as high as 20%, Parliament passed “An Act for restraining the taking of Excessive Usury” – capping the maximum rate at 6%. At the same time, Charles persuades Parliament to impose hearth taxes on the British people which required biyearly audits of every household. Where Parliament wouldn't agree with Charles, he bypassed them by borrowing directly from the goldsmiths in exchange for \"tax futures\" tallied to the smiths at a discount. By 1671, the discount on the King’s tax debt reached 10% which was above the 6% cap and thus could not be paid back. In 1672, the King wrote a letter to the goldsmiths:\n\n    “Gentlemen, I’m an honest man, but unfortunately I am unable to pay my debts back on this occasion. Sorry – will see what I can do.”\n\nAs a result of the Great Stop of 1672, the majority of London's goldsmiths were ruined, and as many as ten thousand families were \"financially embarrassed\". The **Deep State** had successfully mitigated the threat of independent banking and was preparing to establish a new type of centralized bank - the Bank of England.",

It was so low that the people could not\nstand erect. . . . They called a meeting together and discussed how they could raise the sky. But\nthey were at a loss to know how to do so. No one was strong enough to lift the sky. Finally the\nidea occurred to them that possibly the sky might be moved by the combined efforts of the\npeople, if all of them pushed against it at the same time. But then the question arose of how it\nwould be possible to make all the people exert their efforts at exactly the same moment. For the\ndifferent peoples would be far away from one another, some would be in this part of the world,\nothers in another part. What signal could be given that all people would lift at precisely the same\ntime? Finally, the word 'Yahu!' was invented for this purpose. It was decided that all the people\nshould shout Tahu!'\n```",

Sludge used to be dumped in the ocean before that created vast dead zones, so the EPA about 30 years ago approved it for use as a fertilizer because it contains high levels of nutrients that help plants grow. Industry calls sludge that has been lightly treated to eliminate pathogens “biosolids”.\n\nBut sludge also contains every chemical flushed into sewer systems by residential plumbing or industry. Because PFAS are so widely used in industrial processes and added to thousands of consumer products, they are found in the sewage system at high levels. The Sierra Club has characterized sludge as “the most pollutant-rich manmade substance on Earth”.”",

Corrections over anthrax vaccine injustices were almost nonexistent due to the decades-long diversion caused by the anthrax letter attacks of 2001. Those attacks, perpetrated by an Army scientist responsible for the vaccine program, disrupted justice for approximately 1,000 punished troops. Ten years later, the FBI found the “motive” for the anthrax mailings was to evoke fear and to save the “failing” anthrax vaccine. The FBI took so long that neither the Congress nor the courts ever held the military accountable for the underlying legal violations.",

Why? If you want to be a good scientist you need a strong math (and English!) foundation, curiosity, and the mental tools to think in a disciplined way. What 3nd graders don't need is to learn, yet again, how helpless they are to stop various species of animals from dying.\n[Ari Asulin](https://www.facebook.com/protricity?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDEwNTMyODI4MTA4Mzk4Nl8xMDQ2NzQ0NzkzMTk0MDg0\u0026__cft__[0]=AZXi_iwX8X1v13MqsxzIKtshO5rJMp4eqsumHPOYElklgBHd-vqhBIhnJJCDKcciIKJfSKTUnsV-jvY6aQL0TKBnaCYzIfDRtWk2e_QIodYkfKvExb67O4VVKtw0JQRowb8\u0026__tn__=R]-R)\n\nWell you know I disagree, but to answer the question - parents are picking up on the reality that the school format doesn't actually educate as much as conform. Evidence is in the failing literacy rates and overall lack of retention after a student leaves school. This is because Math has nearly no application in the real world and focuses on bizarre and difficult concepts like calculus that, again, do not really reflect reality, only virtual reality. It's in this virtual reality that all our sciences currently exist - which again implies a myriad of evidence that the system is NOT working - we are sicker than ever, poorer than ever, and in WW3. So whatever the math was telling us this whole time was misleading, and the bias that exists when armies hide their own casualties exists throughout the establishment, not just in the military. I've seen it in every corporation I've been involved in. English is the most broken language in human history, and I would like to see it obsolesce in our lifetime. Either go back to Latin, or rediscover the indigenous languages that latin had a hand in destroying. We will never find common ground with intangible concepts. Even Einstein said so. Something will have to give, and soon",

The layers of meaning in the Emerald Tablet are associated with the creation of the philosopher’s stone, the alchemical magnum opus, and the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm. And if you are thinking “This is a formica table. Green is its color” I’m doing well my job. And if you even thought to the Emerald City of The Wizard of Oz (constant reference in many works of Lynch) are just proud of you. It probably does not mean anything … or it means that Lynch, while doing research on The Wizard of Oz and the meaning of the Emerald City (the color of which is obviously green), came across the emerald table… But of course these are only speculations and maybe it’s just a Mark Frost or Bob Engel’s idea. ",

      "message": "The Yonger Dryas is a brief period at the end of the 4.5 billion year Earth timeline in in the Uniformitarianism model. Contrasting with that theory is Catastrophic model, which asserts that the earth formed rapidly in a short series of 'creation' events over less than 6000 years. In the latter model, there is an ice age starting at 2193 B.C.E. when Earth leaves Saturn's last Absu layer. The polar regions experience a *permanent winter* since that moment. I don't mind using Boch Saga or the Yonger Dryas theory in a timeline, but the scale would have to be shortened considerably to be realistic. After all, there is no way to prove anything happened over thousands of years, if nobody was keeping a log of events every single day. Without that kind of source, we can't scale timelines that large. The only real evidence for million year timelines is the theory of carbon dating, which has been majorly called out as pseudoscience. There's no way to tell if a carbon atom decayed linearly over time, or decayed rapidly in a high-energy event.",

Russia never tried to go to the moon or even orbit it. Most likely because they knew it wasn't outside the van-allen belts and thus not orbitable. No one can explain why they gave up the 'race' and never went to the moon until now (and then crashed). Again the truth is tied up with the fall of the USSR. It was 1990 when the government finally admitted to 'secret' moon missions, obviously a lie. We can't check the lie because duh russia fell apart!",

The radium idea is from Waking Up with Analog.  UFOs and aliens are fake and gay.  UFOs are fake because they're supposed to have aliens in them, whereas most are remote controlled defense crafts.  Gay because of the \"alien\" stories. \"Space\" is just the theatrical venue to sell media in the form of movies and TV shows.

It seems they spent hundreds of years preparing the Earth for one of 2 plans. Either there is a religious conquest of all lands under a single unification - plan A, or they will destroy the country where religion came from after moving the key locations i.e. Jerusalem to new locations they already controlled - plan B. \n\n\"C.E. 1662 to 1679 - Rise of the religious dispute\nBy the middle of the 17th century, The **Deep State** had successfully infiltrated the religions of every region on Earth, leaving behind a disarray of religious disputes and anti-syncretism, and preparing the military orders of each kingdom for a final unification under its control. The plan manifested as a religious Crusade to reconquer the \"holy land\" of the Russian Empire, this time in the name of a Messiah - Jesus Christ. Chronologists would naturally move these events into the 13th century under the account of James I the Conqueror to cover up evidence of **Deep State** involvement.\"\n\nThat was plan A, which failed.

      "message": "Tolkien's own prose translation of Beowulf, published posthumously in 2014 as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary, has been linked to the essay.[8][37] Shippey has argued that the translation throws light on \"what Tolkien really thought in 1936\". Tolkien stated, for instance, that Beowulf was not an actual picture of Scandinavia around 500 AD, but was a self-consistent picture with the marks of design and thought. This might leave the reader wondering, commented Shippey, what exactly Tolkien meant by that. Shippey argued that there was evidence from the chronology given in the 2014 book, supported by the work of scholars such as the archaeologist Martin Rundkvist, that there was serious trouble among the eastern Geats, with migration and the taking over of mead-halls by new leaders, at that time, just as portrayed in the poem.[39][40] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics#Scholars",

Simple trick, and it left religions like Hinduism more or less intact. So you can't find an Indian today who thinks Buddhism is a false religion of the Hindus. You can only find people who 'believe in it' or 'dont'. The most fake thing about history isn't the locations named in holy texts and ancient chronologies - it's the *misnaming* of those locations in modern day. Israel isn't in Palestine. Rome was never the center of an Empire. Etc etc",

So Wind, Hydrogen batteries, and Hydro power could take center stage as the \"answer\" to impeding \"doom\" from the pushed Global Warming narrative.\n\nMaybe the older accidents from Three mile island and Chernobyl were also events that could be associated with Industry signaling that would begin the  mechanisms of change in order to sway/corale public opinion towards the next planned narrative.\n\nLook at the main investors...

Because this is how the industry acts towards all adverse reactions in general. If they aren't reported, they don't exist. If they are reported, it's always something else, not the thing the doctor did. This is exposing all the bias in the system at once. Winner take all",

There are too many structures around the world for one society to have constructed them - unless they used **robots**. The neo-classic building construction is **too perfect**.  Essentially in 1894 and several times later, someone used these machines for war when they were never designed that way. The Tripod design is specifically built to **construct buildings** in an automated fashion. That's why they need to be so tall. Higher than the tallest steeple!",

His work leads us to believe Sabbatheans were camouflaged shock troops who integrated Kabbalah/Freemasonic concepts into the French Revolution but also had a weight in the subsequent turn of events with Napoleon when he went after as much conquest as he could achieve … \n",

Curiously, though, only 7.2% had actually been diagnosed with a major depressive episode — a statistical discrepancy that hints at massive antidepressant overprescribing. As noted by Newsweek:\n\n“Although there is widespread agreement that SSRIs [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] help some people with severe depression, these patients are a small minority of people who take the drugs.”\n\nWhile those statistics are already staggering, depression rates have further risen since then, thanks to COVID lockdowns and the unprecedented fearmongering that has been a hallmark of this pandemic. As reported in “What Does the Best Evidence Say About Antidepressants?” 22.4% of American adults reported symptoms of depression in June 2022, compared to 7.1% in 2017.\n\n",
